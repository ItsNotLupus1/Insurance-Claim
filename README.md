# Insurance Claim

Insurance Claim Web Application was developed to allow users to apply for Health Insurance claims in a really easy manner, The users first have to register the main holder of the insurance with the application and after that is done they can also register the
dependants of the holder if there are any, there is a primary Dependants registration form but if there are more than one dependants then using the add icon next to the form the user can register as many dependants as he wants
then the user have to regsiter their policy details with the application where the user has to provide details such as what type of  Insurance it is, what is the policy registration number, the policy start date, the maturity amount etc.
After that the user can claim their insurance any time they want, they just have to login back into the application, fill up the Claim Form and submit various documents related to policy for verification if needed  using the
Multiple File Upload Functionality, then one major advantage of this application is that, users can search for hospitals where they can search on the basis of hosiptal ratings, hospital name, city, state. and hospital list will be displayed
on the left side of the page and on the right side of the page, google maps is displayed which shows the hospitals based on the search results and the map is centered on the user's location, It is achieved using the html's geolocation 
API ,since the map  is centered on user's own location , it shows the hospitals on the vicinity so users also get to choose the nearest hospitals which match its search criteria
